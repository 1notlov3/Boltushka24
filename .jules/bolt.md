# Bolt's Journal - Critical Learnings

## 2024-05-22 - [Prisma Select Optimization]
**Learning:** Using default Prisma `findMany` queries fetches all scalar fields, which can add up in global components like `NavigationSidebar`.
**Action:** Always check if a component uses a subset of fields and use `select` to minimize data transfer. Verified that `NavigationSidebar` only needs `id`, `name`, and `imageUrl`, allowing us to exclude `inviteCode`, `profileId`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

## 2026-01-25 - [Prisma Include vs Select]
**Learning:** Found `include: { members: true }` in `pages/api/socket/messages/index.ts` which fetches all members of a server (potentially thousands) just to find the current user's member ID. This is a significant scalability bottleneck.
**Action:** Replaced O(N) in-memory filtering with O(1) direct database lookup using `db.member.findFirst`. Also applied `select: { id: true }` to other existence checks to minimize payload.

## 2026-01-25 - [RSC Payload Optimization]
**Learning:** `ServerSidebar` was passing the entire `server` object (with all members and channels) to every `ServerMember` component, even though `ServerMember` didn't use it. This multiplied the RSC payload size by the number of members.
**Action:** Removed unused `server` prop from `ServerMember` and its usage in `ServerSidebar`. Always verify if props passed from Server to Client components are actually used.
